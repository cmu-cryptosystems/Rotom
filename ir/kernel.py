Kernel operations and representations.

This module defines kernel operations that represent high-level tensor
operations in the intermediate representation. Kernels bridge the gap
between tensor operations and homomorphic encryption operations by
providing a structured representation of computations.

Key Components:

- KernelOp: Enumeration of supported kernel operations
- Kernel: Representation of a kernel with layout IR terms
