"""
Strassen's algorithm optimization for matrix multiplication.

This module implements Strassen's algorithm optimization for matrix multiplication
in homomorphic encryption. Strassen's algorithm reduces the number of
multiplications required for matrix multiplication from O(nÂ³) to approximately
O(n^2.807), providing significant computational savings for large matrices.

Key Concepts:
- Strassen's Algorithm: Divide-and-conquer approach to matrix multiplication
- Tiled Layouts: Requires specific tiled layout patterns for operands
- Multiplication Reduction: Reduces the number of expensive multiplications
- Recursive Decomposition: Breaks large matrices into smaller subproblems
